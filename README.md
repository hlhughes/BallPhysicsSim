# BallPhysicsSim
## Motivation
I want to get better at writing organized and well-structured code, keeping good documentation, and having good version control practices. I thought that the best way to do this would be to build a project from the ground up. I've always seen videos similar to this online, and I wanted to create my own version.

## Demo
This is where videos of it will go.

## Getting Started
Probably:
`pip install requirements.txt`
