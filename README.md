# BallPhysicsSim
## Motivation
I've always seen videos similar to this online, and I wanted to create my own version. I thought it would be a good way to learn OpenGL in C++... but then I decided to just create it in Python, using pygame, which has a lower learning curve.

I also wanted to learn how to create a project from the ground up. I want to get better at writing organized and well-structured code, keeping good documentation, and having good version control practices.

## Demo
This is where videos of it will go.

## Getting Started
Probably:
`pip install requirements.txt`
